# Make20

A 2048-style puzzle game for [Even Realities G2](https://www.evenrealities.com/) smart glasses.

Merge identical numbers on a 4x4 board to create larger numbers. The goal is to reach ⑳ (20).

## How It Works

Unlike the original 2048 (which doubles: 2→4→8→...), Make20 uses sequential numbers (①→②→③→...). When two identical tiles merge, they become the next number (e.g. ③+③=④).

The board is rendered entirely with Unicode characters (circled numbers ①-⑳) to work within the G2's text container system.

```
┌─ ─ ─ ─┐
│① ② 　 ④│
│　 ③ ①  │
│② 　 ⑤ ①│
│　 ④ 　 ②│
└─ ─ ─ ─┘
```

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Scroll up / down | Move tiles |
| Tap | Switch direction (↕ vertical ↔ horizontal) |

The current direction is shown in the header. Scroll moves tiles along the active axis.

## Features

- Smooth tile sliding animation with pixel-level movement
- Score tracking with high score persistence
- Auto-save and resume on reconnect
- Game over detection

## Architecture

The game uses 4 text containers (the G2 maximum):

| Container | ID | Purpose |
|-----------|----|---------|
| evt | 1 | Invisible event capture (full screen) |
| header | 2 | Score, high score, max tile, controls guide |
| static | 3 | Board with borders and stationary tiles |
| moving | 4 | Animated tiles (pixel-offset during slides) |

During slide animations, the `moving` container is shifted by pixel offsets (`xPosition` / `yPosition`) to create smooth tile movement without rebuilding text each frame.
